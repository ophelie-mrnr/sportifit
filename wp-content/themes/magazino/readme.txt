IMPORTANT NOTES: 
 * Any post set as "Sticky" will be automatically added to the homepage slider.
 * The homepage slider is only activated if there is at least 2 featured/sticky posts.
 * For the slider featured image, the ideal width is at least 1000px and the ideal height is at least 300px. Any part of the featured image that exceeds this dimension will be automatically cropped.
 * If there is no featured image set for a post in the slider, the first image found will be used instead. (This only works for the slider)
 * If the recommended "Multiple Post Thumbnails" plugin is installed, the secondary featured image will be used by as the the thumbnail for the grid posts. If nothing found (or the plugin is not installed), then the first image attached to the post will be used in the grid posts instead.
 * The ideal size for the featured image on the homepage grid thumbnails is 300x200 pixels.
